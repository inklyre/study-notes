Here is the list of people/repositories/organisations/programmes whom I specially thank for their work or inspiration

- [IIT Madras BS degree - Data Science and Applications](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) - I'm a student of this programme. So there must not be the need to explain my thankfullness.
- The site is created using [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Comment system by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) based on Github Discussions
- Notes section of System commands page is almost completely because of [cheriangeorge/System-Commands-course](https://github.com/cheriangeorge/System-Commands-course)
